# wordpuzzle

I have created a simple web prototype. I have tested the code on firefox
and chrome.

The bold letters are the puzzle. Select a substring using mouse.
Below that selection there will appear two arrows allowing you to
rotate/shift the substring inplace either leftwise or rightwise. You
just need to select a substring once and by repeatedly clicking on the arrow
you can shift the string multiple times.

Also I have provided an input box through which you can input the
puzzle strings and then set it as puzzle by clicking on the 'Set Puzzle String' button.

I have provided few puzzles.
First try to solve them normally without any restriction.
Then you can restrict yourself to moves
which require rotation in groups of 3 or 4.
